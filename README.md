As a high school student with a passion for computer science, I have created this website to showcase my skills and achievements.

The website contains a compilation of my various endeavors and assignments during my time at GSMST. I used a diverse tech stack that includes next.js, react, sass, typescript, python, and other system administration tools to build this website. I also employed git and other version control tools to effectively manage the project.

To ensure seamless deployment and continuous integration, I deployed the website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

I also integrated a blogging system into the website that is powered by MDX and statically generated using next.js. The blog posts are written in markdown and stored in the content directory, which is compiled into HTML using MDX and next.js.

In addition, the website adheres to material design principles, utilizing a range of breakpoints to ensure responsiveness across various devices.

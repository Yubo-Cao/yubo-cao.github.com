As a high school student with a passion for computer science, I have created this website to showcase my skills and achievements.

The website contains a compilation of my various projects and achievements. I used a diverse tech stack that includes next.js, react, sass, typescript, python, and other system administration tools to build this website. I also employed git as a version control system for this project.

The website adheres to material design principles, utilizing a range of breakpoints to ensure responsiveness across various devices. The website is designed carefully with the prototype created in Figma before any code is written.

To ensure seamless deployment and continuous integration, I deployed the website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

I also integrated a blogging system into the website that is powered by MDX and statically generated using next.js. The blog posts are written in markdown and stored in the content directory, which is compiled into HTML using MDX and next.js.

This website serves as a compilation of my various endeavors and assignments
from my tenure at GSMST. I built this website using a tech stack that includes
next.js, react, sass, typescript, python, and other system administration tools.
Additionally, I utilized git and other version control tools to manage the
project.

The website is deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions for continuous
integration and deployment.

This website also comes with a blogging system that is powered by MDX and
statically generated using next.js. The blog posts are written in markdown and
are stored in the `content` directory. The blog posts are then compiled into
HTML using MDX and next.js.

## Tech Stack

-   `next.js`

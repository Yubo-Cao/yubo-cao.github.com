First of all, for everyone who is reading this, I wish you a happy new year! I
hope you have a great year with goals achieved and dreams fulfilled. Most
importantly, I hope you are **free from COVID-19**.

## Reflect

### 2nd semester of my freshman year

2022 is a very fast year for me. I transition from a freshman to a sophomore
now, and I completed my AP CSP with a 5, which is kinda expected. Unfortunately,
I didn't get a 100 on the exam, so unlike Andrew, I don't get an award. But
overall, my freshman year is a success for me, as I pretty much get a high A in
all my courses, except Language Arts. The second semester of my freshman year
doesn't teach me a lot of new things, and the pressure seems to be significantly
reduced compared to the first semester as if the first semester is a test to see
if I am competent and motivated enough to continue my study in the school.

### Summer vacation

Over the summer, I play around with GUI, Python, and Spiders.

-   [Quizlet Helper](https://github.com/Yubo-Cao/quizlet_helper) I use
    Playwright to automate the process of creating and editing Quizlet sets.
-   [Grade Checker](https://github.com/Yubo-Cao/grade_checker) Use `requests`,
    `aiohttp`, and `lxml` to check my grades on the school website. This
    calculates the grade into 5 significant digits and alarms me when the grade
    is dropped. The GUI is made with the `Tkinter` and `sun-valley-ttk` themes.
    Due to the limitation of `Tkinter`, it's not responsive and the GUI looks
    outdated.

-   [Todo List](https://github.com/Yubo-Cao/todo_list) YES! I finally made a
    to-do list! I use `PyQt5` to make a GUI for the to-do list. This project
    integrates our old grade checker as an extension, so we can modify the
    priority of the to-do list based on the grades. It uses plain `YAML` with a
    huge amount of meta-class and operator overloading to make the code looks
    nice and accurate---not really---it just ends up being a mess of
    higher-order functions and meta-programming that nobody could debug or
    figure out what was going on. I am currently rewriting this with `Tauri` and
    `React` stuff that I learned, as the modern web development and frontend the
    frameworks seem to far surpass the old OOP-styled, imperative programming I
    used to do.

    ![Todo List](/images/blog/2023-new-year/grade_todo.png)

Beyond that, I also read about deep learning. And it turns out that they are not
as hard as one would expect---at least, one just needs to understand how to call
the functions and piece them up, with a high-level understanding of math would
suffice. I also read about the _A history of the world in 6 Glasses_ by Tom
Standage, as required by my Language Arts class. It's a very interesting book
that tells the history of the world through the development of different drinks.
I spasmodically hang out with my friends as shown in
[my about page](/about#friends). Beyond that, I spend a lot of time in edX and
self-studied the majority of AP Calculus. And honestly, that's my summer
vacation, a not very productive yet entertaining one.

### Back to school

#### Class

So I get a sufficient amount of break, and now I am back to school. As always, I
get a high A on the majority of my courses, except Language Arts (92). I am
extremely surprised by my AP World History course as my teacher gave me a 100 on
the first exam and I ended up having a 98 in this course. I would like to
express my heartfelt gratitude to my teacher, Ms. NT and Ms. Calhoun for their
support and guidance on my science fair course, for otherwise, I would not have
been able to finish my project and get an A in her class---I started my semester
with an 85.

But in short, that's nothing to be proud of, it's just a ground truth that
everyone in GSMST gets 100 regardless.

#### Extra-curricular activities

##### CyberPatriot

I am proud to announce that I serve as an officer at the cyber-security
Department of the CS club, especially in light of the extraordinary results of
our team in the CyberPatriot competition achieved: Lambda (my team) is the first
team in silver, Mu and Phi being the first and second in the gold tier, and Psi
had advanced to platinum. All those are achieved through self-paced courses,
several lectures, and most importantly, the innovative ideas brought by
brilliant Anish. I am proud to be a part of this team, and I am looking forward
to the next competition.

##### Algorithm

I just crammed the algorithm course in the last few weeks of the semester. So,
no surprise, I joined USACO and stuck at the bronze level. For certain, I will
try again next year. I will learn a lot more about algorithms and data
structures (hopefully).

##### FTC Robotics

Robotics is such a fun activity full of engineering and programming---imagine,
having a robot that simply won't respond to any of your commands nor are you
able to connect to it wirelessly, simply because of unmatched firmware and
software versions. I am unjust to say it's a totally fun activity, but the joy
when you finally get it to work is just unparalleled. I worked on coding aspects
of the projects:

-   [FTC Document](https://github.com/Yubo-Cao/FTC) A continuous integration
    system for FTC projects. It uses `GitHub Actions` to build and logbook from
    the logbook entries written in `YAML`, and rendered to `TeX` using `jinja2`
    ad custom Python scripts.

-   [FTC Controller](https://github.com/Yubo-Cao/RedFtcController) A fork of the
    official FTC controller, with our code added. It's written in `Kotlin`. We
    abandoned it eventually and resort to OnBotJava.

There isn't much success in the competition, but I am proud of the work we did.
With new fixes and improvements conducted over the winter break, I am looking
forward to the next competition.

##### React and website

The website you are currently reading is made with React. It underwent 3
iterations before I settled on the current one.

1. I started with hand-crafted HTML/CSS/JS. It's a hand-written static website
   and copy-paste is the only way to update the website. It's not responsive and
   the code is a mess.

    ![Version 1 website](/images/blog/2023-new-year/website_version_1.png)

2. Quickly, I write this website with a bit more knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS. Since
   I learned more about the importance of responsive design and fitting smaller
   screen devices, an unbearable amount of media queries is added to the CSS
   file, as I was ignorant about the existence of `flex-wrap` and
   `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));`. And just to
   over-complicate things, I used `jinja2` and a custom Python script to
   generate the HTML file with server-side injection, etc. At that time, I don't
   realize that GitHub Action could run any code I want, so I manually run that
   script and let it mess up my local repository will all kinds of files. I also
   started to think about reusability and modularity, so I started to break the
   website into components:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            ...
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="nav.css" />
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="header.css" />
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="logo.css" />
            ...
            <script src="nav.js" defer></script>
            <script src="header.js" defer></script>
            <script src="logo.js" defer></script>
        </head>
        <body>
            ...
            <header>
                <div class="logo">...</div>
                <nav>...</nav>
            </header>
        </body>
    </html>
    ```

    The result is I have to write that kind of stuff for every single page.
    That's not elegant nor maintainable. We also find patterns in the code,
    where it's literally `div` nested with `div` with all the crazy class names
    and IDs. One important note is that I started to use `SASS` to write `CSS`,
    and I defined a lot of `mixin` following the Tailwind CSS convention:

    ```sass
    @mixin text-2xl
        font-size: 1.5rem
        line-height: 2rem
    ```

    It's sweet when you write `@include text-2xl` in your `CSS` file. The mobile
    support is still in progress, but it's much better than the previous
    version.

    ![Version 2 website](/images/blog/2023-new-year/website_version_2.png)

3. I finally decided to use `Next.js`. I get rid of my old friend, SASS, and
   started to use Tailwind CSS instead. I also started to use `TypeScript` and
   `React` to write the website. Since `Next.js` comes with server-side
   generation, I no longer need to build a custom script to generate the HTML
   file and it will automatically generate a static website into the `out/`
   folder. Following the guidelines of `Tailwind CSS` is pretty good, although
   it makes my HTML looks like a mess:

    ```html
    <div
        class="p-4 transition-all cursor-pointer bg-white rounded-lg border border-primary-200 hover:shadow-md hover:shadow-primary-300/30 active:shadow-lg active:shadow-primary-400/30 flex flex-row gap-4 items-start justify-start flex-wrap"
    >
        ...
    </div>
    ```

    But since in code, I just write components like

    ```tsx
    <Card></Card>
    ```

    it's not that bad. I am proud to declare that mobile support is complete,
    and the website is responsive to all kinds of devices. And as you might
    guess, that's how I spent my winter break.

Welcome to the inaugural post of this highly advanced digital platform. In the
following series of posts, I shall delve into the intricate details of my
personal and academic experiences.

This blog has been meticulously crafted using the `Next.js` framework, a highly
efficient and modular solution for server-rendered React applications. The
markdown formatting is facilitated by the `react-markdown` library, which
seamlessly integrates with the React ecosystem. The visually stunning theme is
based on the `tailwindcss` framework, a utility-first CSS library that allows
for the rapid prototyping of visually appealing layouts.

For those interested in the inner workings of this website, the source code is
readily available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yubo-Cao/yubo-cao.github.com)
for your perusal. The website is hosted on the highly reliable and widely used
GitHub Pages platform.
